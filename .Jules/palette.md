## 2024-05-23 - Persistent Editor Settings and Semantic Feedback
**Learning:** Users find it frustrating when non-serialized editor settings (like directory paths) reset on every script reload or domain reload. Using `EditorPrefs` scoped with `Application.dataPath` provides a robust, project-specific persistence mechanism that survives reloads without modifying asset files. Additionally, replacing generic "Info" status boxes with dynamic `MessageType` (Error/Warning) significantly improves the clarity of operation results.
**Action:** When creating custom Editor tools that require file paths or configuration not suitable for serialization on the target component, always implement `EditorPrefs` persistence in `OnEnable`/`OnDisable`. Ensure all status feedback uses appropriate visual severity levels.
