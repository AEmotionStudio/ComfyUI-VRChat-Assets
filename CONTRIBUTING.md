## Development Setup

To get started with development, you'll need to set up a VRChat world project. The recommended way to do this is by using the [VRChat Creator Companion (VCC)](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/).

1.  **Install VRChat Creator Companion:** Download and install the VCC from the official VRChat website.
2.  **Create a New Project:** Use the VCC to create a new VRChat World project. This will ensure you have the correct Unity version and all the necessary VRChat SDKs.
3.  **Install UdonSharp:** In the VCC, manage your new project and add the "UdonSharp" package from the Community Packages.
4.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
5.  **Add to your Project:** You can either import the `.unitypackage` or copy the `Image Display`, `Video Display`, `Scripts`, and `Materials` folders into the `Assets` directory of your VCC project. For active development, copying the folders is recommended.
